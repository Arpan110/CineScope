# CineScope
ðŸŽ¬ CineScope is a modern and responsive Movie Browser web application built to help users discover, search, and explore movies and TV shows with ease. Powered by The Movie Database (TMDB) API, it delivers real-time information on trending, upcoming, and popular media content from around the world.
The app features a clean and intuitive UI that showcases movies in a grid layout with high-quality posters and key details like ratings, release year, and genres. Users can search for specific titles, filter by genre or release date, and sort results by popularity, rating, or newest releases. Each movie has a detailed page with its trailer, overview, cast, runtime, and related recommendations.

Users can add movies to a personalized watchlist, which is stored using either browser storage or Firebase Auth for a full-stack experience. The UI is fully responsive, ensuring smooth performance on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Features like infinite scroll, dark mode, loading skeletons, and debounced search enhance usability and performance.
